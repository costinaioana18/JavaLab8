I completed the compulsory tasks:

- Creating a database having the name MusicAlbums using Oracle

- Crating a user with the name *dbase* and the password *sql*

- Creating the given tables, artists and albums

- Loading the database driver to the project 

- Creating the singleton class Database that managages the connection to the database

- Creating the DAO ArtistController class

- Creating the DAO AlbumController class

- Implementing a simple test using my classes (see the testFunctionality method in the Database class)
(I must be missing something tho because it doesn't work the way it's supposed to)

**Check the database.jpg image in order to see how the tables look like**
